# MusicalAnything

Play a game like Musical Chairs, but doens't have to be with chairs!  Make up your own rules as to what to do when the music stops. 
Examples: 
- Talk Like a Pirate
- Do Silly Walks
- Talk with an accent

Customize how often the music pauses and how long it remains paused

Make a folder with music files to play and point the program at it, Random Mode is enabled by default.

To change the visualization, run WMP Classic manually and change it in the settings.  Restart MusicalAnything and the new visualization will be there.

### Known issues: 
- Visualizations sometimes stop working.  This is an issue with WMP Classic
